# くコ:彡 (The Skwid Programming Language)
 くコ:彡 (Skwid from now on) is a small functional (and arguably esoteric) language whose code compiles directly to python lambdas, allowing full interoperability with Python 3. This means that every function inside Skwid has a direct translation to Python and can be fed any data type that the parent language allows. To top it off, you only need NumPy to run the compiler!
 
 ## Features
 
 Skwid has the following advantages:
 * Its code is really small, so it's ideal for code golf!
 * It allows tacit programming
 * Great for numerical algorithms
 * Integrating it with Python 3 is trivial
